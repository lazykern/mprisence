### Configuration System

- Configuration structure improvements:
  - New `[activity_type]` section:
    - `default = "listening"` - choose between listening/watching/playing/competing

  - Formatted values: `track_display ("1/12")`, `duration_display ("3:45")`
  - Status variables: `status_icon` (separate from status text)

### CLI Interface

  - Listening (default for audio)
  - Watching (auto-detected for video)
  - Playing and Competing (manually configurable)
- Smarter presence updates that reduce Discord API calls

### Performance
- Reduced CPU usage with debounced updates
- Smart caching for expensive operations
- Memory usage optimizations
- More efficient change detection for player state

### Dependencies
- Updated core dependencies to latest versions
- Added tokio async runtime for better concurrency
- Using reqwest 0.12 for modern HTTP operations

## Config Migration Notes

### Key Changes

If upgrading from 0.5.x, the main changes to make in your config:

1. Add activity type settings (if desired):
   ```toml
   [activity_type]
   use_content_type = true   # Auto-detect from media URLs
   default = "listening"     # Default activity type
   ```

2. Status icons: Previously used in templates like `{{{status_icon}}} {{{artists}}}`, now you can access `status_icon` separately in templates.

3. Player-specific activity types (optional):
   ```toml
   [player.vlc]
   # ... other settings ...
   override_activity_type = "watching"  # Force this player to always use "Watching"
   ```

4. Cover art caching:
   ```toml
   [cover.provider.imgbb]
   expiration = 86400  # Cache time in seconds (24 hours)
   ```
